Sometimes you can not wrap your head around concepts from official doc when you just wanna try it out.

Sometimes you are confused when people are engaged in lively conversations in the post or comments.

Sometimes you google a topic and jargon pops up one after another.

Isn't there a simplified version of page where author talk with you, not explaining something with terminology from another world?

Seeking answers, I've been collecting these keywords whenever I wanna learn something without fuss.

Note that we can understand concepts more deeply in official doc after we grasp basics of them. So official doc is pretty important. After all, some docs are also awesome for us to learn something quickly.
